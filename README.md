# 📚 Machine Learning Portfolio – Post-Graduation in AI

Welcome to my Machine Learning portfolio! This repository contains a curated collection of hands-on activities and projects developed for the **Machine Learning** subject in my post-graduation studies in Artificial Intelligence. It is designed to showcase my practical skills, understanding of core ML concepts, and ability to apply them to real-world datasets.

## 🚀 About This Repository

- **Purpose:** Demonstrate proficiency in machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and data analysis through a series of structured activities.
- **Audience:** Recruiters, fellow students, and anyone interested in my journey through advanced AI studies.
- **Dataset:** [Spambase Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/spambase) (included as `spambase.csv`)

## 📝 Activities Overview

The `classification/` folder contains Jupyter notebooks covering:

- **Algorithm Comparison:**
  - Evaluate and compare F1 scores for k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) using 10-fold cross-validation.
- **Hyperparameter Analysis:**
  - Analyze k-NN with different values of k (3, 5, 7, 9) and discuss precision/recall trade-offs.
- **Model Constraints:**
  - Assess Decision Tree accuracy with limited depth.
- **Advanced Metrics:**
  - Compute AUC for SVM with specific hyperparameters.
- **Feature Importance:**
  - Identify key features in Logistic Regression models.

Each notebook includes code, explanations, and analysis to ensure clarity and reproducibility.
